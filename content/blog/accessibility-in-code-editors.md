There's a moment in most accessibility discussions where someone points to WCAG 2.1 compliance and considers the problem solved. Contrast ratios checked. Alt text added. Tab order verified. Shipped.

For most software, that's a reasonable baseline. For code editors — the tools used by developers themselves — it's barely a start.

The problem is structural. Screen readers are designed for *content consumption*: reading documents, navigating forms, hearing button labels. Code is not content. Code is a spatial, hierarchical, syntactically dense artifact where the *shape* of the text carries meaning. A three-level-deep nested function doesn't just have different words than a top-level one — it has different geometry. Current screen readers flatten that geometry entirely.

## The Experiment

What I built was a real-time auditory feedback system that maps code structure to sound. The core insight: if sighted programmers use visual cues (indentation, syntax highlighting, bracket matching) to understand code structure at a glance, then the equivalent for blind programmers should be *auditory* cues — a soundscape that encodes the same structural information.

Using the Web Audio API, the system generates distinct audio signatures for:

- **Indentation depth** → pitch. Each nesting level raises the fundamental frequency by a perfect fourth. Your ear immediately hears "this code goes deeper."
- **Syntax errors** → a dissonant minor second chord. Unmistakable, slightly uncomfortable. You don't need to see a red squiggle to know something's wrong.
- **Function boundaries** → a subtle resonant tone, like a bell. You're entering a scope.
- **Loop iterations** → rhythmic percussive patterns. Fast loops sound fast.
- **Comments** → softer, muted timbre. Background, not foreground.

```javascript
function pitchForDepth(depth) {
  const BASE_FREQ = 220; // A3
  const RATIO = 4 / 3;  // Perfect fourth
  return BASE_FREQ * Math.pow(RATIO, depth);
}

function playTone(frequency, duration, type = 'sine') {
  const ctx = new AudioContext();
  const osc = ctx.createOscillator();
  const gain = ctx.createGain();

  osc.connect(gain);
  gain.connect(ctx.destination);

  osc.type = type;
  osc.frequency.value = frequency;
  gain.gain.setValueAtTime(0.3, ctx.currentTime);
  gain.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.001, ctx.currentTime + duration);

  osc.start(ctx.currentTime);
  osc.stop(ctx.currentTime + duration);
}
```

## What I Learned About Cognitive Load

The original hypothesis was that auditory cues would *supplement* screen reader output. User testing showed something different: for experienced blind programmers, the screen reader narration was actually the noisier channel. They wanted to hear the code's structure, not have it spelled out word by word.

This led to a *mode* design: the system has a "structure mode" that suppresses verbose narration and emphasizes structural audio, and a "detail mode" that inverts this. The programmer toggles between them depending on whether they're navigating (structure) or writing (detail).

Adaptive difficulty turned out to matter enormously. Beginners need the audio to be explicit and distinct — sounds spaced far apart, unmistakable timbres. Experienced users found this overwhelming and wanted subtle, ambient cues they could ignore when not needed. The system now uses a proficiency model (inferred from typing speed and error rate) to dynamically compress the auditory range.

## The Gap Between Compliance and Inclusion

Here's the harder observation: WCAG compliance, by design, is about removing *barriers*. It doesn't require that tools be *good* for disabled users — just that they not be *blocked*. A code editor that passes accessibility audits can still be functionally unusable for a blind programmer if the screen reader output is a stream of "bracket, bracket, colon, bracket" with no structural context.

Genuine inclusion requires asking what the *equivalent experience* looks like. Not "can a blind user technically activate this button?" but "does a blind developer have the same situational awareness while coding that a sighted developer has?" Those are very different questions.

The tools we use to build software shape what software gets built. If programming tools are hostile to disabled developers, those developers leave. And then we build products designed by — and implicitly for — people without those disabilities. The cycle is self-reinforcing.

Building accessible tooling isn't separate from building good software. It's the same work, done more carefully.

The project is live and open source. If you work in assistive technology or know blind programmers who want to try it, I'd genuinely like feedback.
